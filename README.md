## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the creation of high-performance and scalable network applications. If you're new to Node.js, start here to understand its fundamental concepts.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Node.js, this section will help you set up your development environment, install Node.js, and write your first "Hello World" program using Node.js.

## Basic Syntax

Learn the basic syntax and structure of Node.js applications. Explore how to declare variables, work with functions, use conditional statements, and organize your code effectively.

## Asynchronous Programming

One of Node.js's most powerful features is its ability to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. Dive into the world of callbacks, Promises, and async/await to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple tasks concurrently.

## Modules and Packages

In this section, discover how to modularize your Node.js code using modules. Learn about the built-in modules available in Node.js and explore how to create your own modules. Additionally, we'll cover how to manage external packages using npm (Node Package Manager).

## RESTful APIs

Building RESTful APIs is a common use case for Node.js. Learn how to create a basic RESTful API using popular frameworks like Express.js. Understand routing, handling HTTP requests, and sending responses to build robust APIs.
